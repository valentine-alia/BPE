This folder contains some of our experiments with the simple harmonic oscillator.

- `basic_SHO_and_2_body_problem.ipynb` is all sorts of random stuff - it has code that runs VBMC for a basic harmonic oscillator case for different numbers of max fn evaluations, as well as some test code for KL divergence that is now obsolete. It also has some code that runs VBMC for the analytical solution of the 2-body problem. 

- `noisy_sho.ipynb` was used to generate a figure for our poster, it runs VBMC with varying levels of noise in the SHO solution. 

vps generated from these notebooks are in the subfolder `vps`s
