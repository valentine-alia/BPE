This repo is home to the code from the Bayesian Parameter Estimation (BPE) group of the Summer of Undergraduate Applied Math Instutute (SUAMI) at Carnegie Mellon University for Summer 2023.

For our project, we examined the robustness of Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) for estimating parameters in differential equations. See `BPE_poster.pdf` for a poster that gives a general overview of what we've done.

## Setting up a differential equation for PyVBMC:

1. Set up numerical integration using scipy's `solve_ivp`
2. Define
