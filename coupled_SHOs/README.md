VBMC applied to coupled harmonic oscillators.

Here we use VBMC to estimate the spring constants of these systems. `2_oscillators.ipynb` and `3_oscillators.ipynb` do this for 2 and 3 coupled harmonic oscillators, respectively. 

- `coupled_oscillators_script.py` is a script for running on supercomputers that runs vbmc many times to see how it performs on a system of 3 coupled harmonic oscillators. Results from this script are in the `vps` subfolder.
