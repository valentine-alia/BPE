Here are the metrics we've developed this summer. 

- `metrics.py` has the Delaunay CI metric, euclidean metric, and KL divergence as adapted from PyVBMC. 

- `n_dim_Del_integral.ipynb` includes the code for the Delaunay CI metric again, as well as commentary that explains said code, some nice plotting functions for visualizing Delaunay triangulation in 3D.
