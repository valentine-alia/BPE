In the subfolder `concatenating_experiment` there is updated code to concatenate solutions of and run VBMC for the equation $\ddot{x} = -x - ax^b$

- `analysis.ipynb` is code for plotting vps and calculating metrics for these runs. 

- `better_concatenating.ipynb` generates the vps for this equation. The vps themselves are in the `vps` folder.
