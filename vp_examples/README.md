This folder contains several example varational posteriors that we use for plotting, demoing code, etc. Here's a description of what each one is:

- `3d_for_plotting_vp.pkl`- VBMC VP result for case of 2 coupled harmonic oscillators (generated from `2_oscillators.ipynb`)
- `3d_vp_reasonable.pkl` - success of VBMC for SEIR model. (generated from `SEIR_model.ipynb`)
- `3D_vp.pkl` - from VBMC run in `bimodal_for_grace.ipynb`. Here VBMC struggled to find 2 regions of high probability density (but we also gave it not great bounds)
- `4d_oscillators_vp.pkl` - success of VBMC for case of 3 coupled harmonic oscillators (generated from  `3_oscillators.ipynb`)
- `doubly_peaked_vp.pkl` - sucess of VBMC at creating VP with two peaks. (generated from `bimodal_for_grace.ipynb`)
- `sho_toy.pkl` - success of VBMC for case of singular harmonic oscillator. (generated from `basic_SHO_and_2_body_problem.ipynb`)
- `wild_and_wacky_3d_vp.pkl` - failure of VBMC for case of 2 coupled harmonic oscillators (generated from `2_oscillators.ipynb`)
