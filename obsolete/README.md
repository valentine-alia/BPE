This folder contains a bunch of obsolete code that is either no longer useful or we have improved versions of, but were to afraid to delete. Everything here should be safe to ignore.

Except maybe "concatenating_stuff.ipynb" in concatenating_experiment that has a lot of useful plotting code as well as linear regression of posterior samples.
